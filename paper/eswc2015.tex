\begin{abstract}
Vocabularies play a key role in knowledge bases in general and in the Web of Data in particular. Vocabularies are generally modelled using classes and properties in OWL and RDF languages, for giving semantics to entities used in the Web of Data. Recent initiatives tried to help finding vocabularies in catalogues. However, it is still challenging to classify  vocabularies according to some ``specific'' domain without the help of expert domains, due to either the lack of sufficient metadata or the absence of automatic methods to assign domains to vocabularies.  A good domain classification of vocabularies will yield to accurate searching and clustering in search results in vocabulary catalogues. In this paper, we explore the challenging task of automatic detection and classification of vocabularies using and Natural Language techniques and Machine Learning techniques. We apply the methods in the case of Linked Open Vocabulary catalogue. Comparing the results of expert curators and our findings can settle some preliminary foundation towards the automatic detection of vocabulary domain.

\section{Manual Curation of Domain vocabularies}
\label{sec:curation}

Take a vocab, look at the content and classes..manual identification of the domain.. assignment and/or creation of the domain in LOV backend. Applications: visual in the front-end and in the results page.
